# Advent of Code 2021

The code for all the puzzles I did for Advent of Code 2021

I used Ruby this year since I professionally transitioned back to developing in Ruby full time, and it gave me a great
opportunity to give me a bit more practice with the core language features. My primary goal was to write in a way I
enjoyed, which meant more object-oriented than the problems necessarily required, but I had fun.

Each challenge is sorted in directories that look like the following:

* `Day_XX` - for the day of the challenge (where XX is the day number 1-25)
  * `input_xx.txt` - input file for the day's challenges
  * `P1`/`P2` - for the particular puzzle of the day
    * `puzzle_NN.rb` - executable for the given puzzle (where NN is the puzzle number 1 - 50)
    * `lib` - supporting classes for the challenge
